# Rotate 2D Matrix
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates Rotate 2D Matrix
> specific to Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Description of what each file shows:
* Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

	- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
	- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
	- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
